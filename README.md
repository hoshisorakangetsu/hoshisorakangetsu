I am (Wong) Xuan Bin, also known as [hanyue1014](https://github.com/hanyue1014) as my main github account and [hoshisorakangetsu](https://github.com/hoshisorakangetsu) as my github account mainly for school uses. I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js, and I have experience in TypeScript, Go, Rust, C/C++/C#, Python, PhP and Java.
